## Challenge topic 1: Build your minimal quantum circuit - making a quantum calculator

Building adders can be useful in many situations when solving real-world problems 
using quantum algorithms. You can make adders with quantum circuits Just like in 
classical computation, where you can combine different logical gates (e.g., AND, OR, 
XOR, etc.) to create binary adders. There are various methods to create the logical 
circuits that performs addition. 

### - Half adder [1] 
### - Full adder [1]
### - Plain adder network [2]
### - Ripple Carry Adder [3] 
### - QFT Adder [4], [5]
### - QFT Const Adder [5]
### - QFT Arithmetic Adder [5]

At this challenge, we will ask you to build a minimal quantum circuit to make 4-digit 
numbers adders including carry-up of digits with any technique you want to use. For 
example, 1100+1010=10110. And, try to reduce the error of the adder on the real 
device, IBM Quantum Systems, as much as possible. 
Additional challenge: Try to make the UI of a quantum calculator.
